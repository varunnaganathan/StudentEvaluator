My name is Sadia Islam, and I am writing to express my strong interest in the MSc Business with 
Marketing  Management  program  at  Northumbria  University  London  for  the  September  2024 
intake. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in English from Begum Badrunnessa 
Government  Girlâ€™s  College,  affiliated  with  the  University  of  Dhaka.  My  undergraduate  studies 
honed  my  critical  thinking  and  communication  skills,  which  I  believe  are  crucial  for  success  in 
business (CGPA: 2.52 out of 4.00, equivalent to 55 percent). I further developed my academic 
foundation  with  a  Higher  Secondary  School  Certificate  in  Humanities  and  a  Secondary  School 
Certificate. Since October 2017, I have been gaining valuable experience as a Sales Associate at 
Aarong,  a  prominent  Bangladeshi  company.  This  role  has  fostered  my  communication, 
interpersonal, and problem-solving abilities.  Engaging with customers and understanding their 
needs has provided a firsthand perspective on consumer behavior and market trends, igniting my 
passion for marketing. 
The  United  Kingdom's  reputation  for  academic  excellence,  innovative  teaching  methods,  and 
diverse cultural tapestry makes it an ideal destination for my postgraduate studies.  However, I 
am  particularly  drawn  to  Northumbria  University  London's  campus  situated  in  the  heart  of 
London. This location offers unparalleled access to renowned firms, government institutions, and 
historical  landmarks,  fostering  invaluable  networking  opportunities,  internships,  and  practical 
exposure to international business. 
The  MSc  Business  with  Marketing  Management  program  at  Northumbria  University  London 
perfectly aligns with my career aspirations.  My experience at Aarong has fueled my desire to 
delve deeper into the field of marketing. This program's focus on both strategic business practices 
and  marketing  principles  equips  graduates  with  a  well-rounded  skillset,  making  them  highly 
sought after in the job market.  The curriculum, with modules like Fundamentals in Management 
and  Marketing  Analytics,  directly  complements  my  English  degree  by  providing  a  strong 
foundation in business strategy and data analysis, both of which are crucial for effective marketing 
campaigns in today's digital landscape. 
Northumbria  University  London's  program  stands  out  due  to  its  emphasis  on  practical 
applications and industry connections. The opportunity to learn from experienced faculty who 
are subject-matter experts and collaborate with a diverse student body excites me.  This program 
will equip me with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive as a leader in the international 
business arena, specifically focusing on marketing and business development. 
Upon completing this program, I envision myself returning to Bangladesh and contributing to the 
nation's ever-evolving marketing landscape.  My goal is to secure a marketing manager position 
at  a  prestigious  organization  like  Square  Group,  Beximco,  or  Aarong.    Armed  with  a 
comprehensive  understanding  of  consumer  behavior,  market  trends,  and  strategic  marketing 
principles, I aim to significantly influence brand awareness and propel organizational growth.  My 
ultimate objective is to lead creative marketing initiatives that resonate with a broad range of 

customers,  leveraging  my  particular  interest  in  market  research,  brand  management,  and 
strategic planning. 
My decision to pursue the MSc Business with Marketing Management program at Northumbria 
University London is driven by a desire for academic excellence, professional advancement, and 
a truly enriching experience in the heart of London.  I am confident that Northumbria University 
London offers the perfect environment for me to develop the necessary skills and knowledge to 
become  a  successful  marketing  leader.    I  am  eager  to  contribute  to  the  vibrant  university 
community  and  believe Northumbria  University London  is  the  ideal  springboard  to  launch  my 
international business career. 
 
Thank you for considering my application. 
 
Sincerely, 
Sadia Islam
