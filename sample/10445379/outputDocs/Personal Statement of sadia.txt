My name  is Sadia  Islam,  I  am  writing  to  express my  strong  interest  in  pursuing  the  MSc in 
Marketing program at Ulster University London. I completed my Bachelor's degree in English 
from Begum Badrunnessa Government Girl’s College, affiliated college University of Dhaka, 
with a CGPA of 2.52 out of 4.00 (equivalent to 55 percent). In addition to my undergraduate 
studies, I completed my Higher Secondary School Certificate in Humanities from Chittagong 
City  Corporation  Kaiser-Niloufer  College.  Before  that,  I  obtained  my  Secondary  School 
Certificate in Humanities from Hamida Pilot Girl’s High School & College. These educational 
experiences  have  equipped  me  with  a  diverse  set  of  skills  and  a  broad  understanding  of 
various  disciplines.  Currently,  I  am  employed  as  a  Sales  Associate  at  Aarong,  a  renowned 
company,  since  October  19,  2017.  My  role 
involves  collaborating  with  customers, 
understanding  their  needs,  and  providing  exceptional  service.  Working  in  a  dynamic 
environment  has  allowed  me  to  enhance  my  communication,  interpersonal,  and  problem-
solving skills. It has also given me valuable insights into consumer behavior and market trends, 
igniting my passion for marketing. 
Why I want to study in the UK: 
Compared to other countries like Canada or the USA, the UK has continually maintained an 
outstanding  position  in  the  field  of  education.  Academic  brilliance,  excellent  research,  and 
modern teaching techniques are characteristics of British institutions. The United Kingdom is 
constantly ranked among the top countries in terms of academic performance and research 
methodology. I preferred the UK because of its friendly, English-speaking country, excellent 
education system, diverse culture, laid-back nature, and high standard of living. Moreover, the 
global recognition and diversity of education, technology, and work are attracting me to study 
in the UK. The UK provides a wide choice of academic programs in several subjects. Anyone 
can find a program that matches their interests and professional aspirations, whether they are 
interested in business, engineering, science, the arts, or the humanities. Pursuing a master's 
degree in the UK would enhance my knowledge and skills, enabling me to obtain a well-paying 
job in my country. As a result, I began researching several foreign universities and learned that 
universities  in  the  UK  are  well-known  for  their  high-quality  education,  high  academic 
requirements, and famous professors. It is home to two of the world's top three universities 
and  26  of  the  top  200  finest  learning  institutions  in  the  world  (QS  statistics,  2022).  They 
educated  38%  of  Nobel  Laureates  (British  Council,  2016)  and  more  than  one  in  every  four 
world leaders (University Business, 2021), making the UK the highest-rated country (GREAT 
campaign, 2021 addition).
