No credit is earned for the grades other than A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+ and D. Grade Point Average (GPA)
is calculated by dividing the sum of the grade points earned by the total credit value of courses.
'I' grade is given to a student who has fulfilled the majority of a course but has not completed all the course
requirements. The student should complete all the course requirements in consultation with his/her course
instructor before the end of the following semester, failing which the grade converts to 'F'. The student is not
required to register for the course in the next semester.
'W' grade means withdrawal. A student may decide to withdraw from a course in consultation with his/her
instructor and academic advisor by the official deadline.
'Y' grade means audit. A student may decide to audit a course of his/ her interest. In this case, the student
pays the full tuition fee for the course and attends the classes. However, he/she does not need to complete
any assignments or take any examinations. No credit is earned.
'O' grade is given to a student who has been administratively discontinued by the management as a punitive
measure.
'Z' grade is officially assigned if no grade is received within the official deadline.
This transcript shows the earned credit, grade status for the courses taken at IUB and those transferred from
other institutions, if any and is issued without any erasure.
