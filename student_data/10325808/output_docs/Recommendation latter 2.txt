TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN
I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation in favor of Mr. Abdul Wahid Khan
Registration No. 15-Arid-5254 who has been a student of mine during his under graduate studies.
I have taught him the core course of B.Sc (Hons) Food Technology. He has completed his degree
program in first class with appreciable CGPA 3.41. His hard work got him good grades in most of
the studied courses. He has shown a humble attitude towards his teachers as well as fellow students.
He also carries strong research aptitude and can learn things quickly with good interpersonal skills.
He used to put in extra hours as necessary in order to meet specific academic deadlines. I have also
discovered him to be perseverant and enthusiastic in studies and extracurricular activities.
Therefore, I have no hesitation to recommend him for higher studies/fellowships in Food Science &
Technology offered by different international institutions.
Sincerely,
DR. KASHIF SARFRAZ ABBASI
