It is my pleasure to write some words for Mr. Abdul Wahid Khan S/o Muhammad Ishaq
Khan with Registration No. 15-ARID-5254. Mr. Abdul Wahid is known to me as an
undergraduate student in the Institute of Food and Nutritional Sciences PMAS Arid Agriculture
University Rawalpindi, Pakistan. He is studious student, who always obtained excellent grades in
his academics, he is hardworking young boy with drive and aptitude for research in his field. I
always found him quite cooperative in department activities. He is well organized reliable and
capable of work in diverse setup. He can work independently and is able to follow through to
ensure that the job is gets done. I have no reservation in strongly recommending him for admission
in your university.
I am confident that Mr. Abdul Wahid Khan will give account of himself, if provided an
opportunity for higher education. Please don't hesitate to contact me for any further information.
